- 👋 Hi, I’m @QPiiD; I'm a webdev noob forever!
- 👀 I’m interested in a number of things: 
  - I work as a Chartered Accountant from 9-4 (technically 8-5);
  - I work as a mucisian in the evenings. My stage name is QPiiD.
  - I also study computer science every morning and some evenings.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning WebDev (Full Stack).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment given limited skill.
- 📫 How to reach me: IG:_qpiid, Twitter:@_qpiid, yo hear my music: Soundcloud:@qpiid.
